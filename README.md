## About Project 

This project is based on machine learning and its algorithms, especially Reinforcement learning and its algorithms, that predicts which AD is creating more impact on the users among many different ADs shown to them using **Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm**
I created a machine learning model in which if user clicks on any AD, it shows the higher impactness of that AD on user and it will be rewarded in the code. 
While each time user connects to webpage, that makes a round, and at each round, I choose one AD to display to user.
My aim was to maximize the total rewards and finally, got the result which Ad was creating more impact on the users.
